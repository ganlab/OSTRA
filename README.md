# OSTRA

**OSTRA** is a novel segmentation-then-reconstruction method for segmenting complex open objects in 3D point clouds. This method uses a Segment-Anything Model (SAM) to segment target objects and video object segmentation (VOS) technology to continuously track video frame segmentation targets. Our pipeline enables a complete segmentation process from videos to 3D cloud points and meshes in different level(semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and part segmentation).

## :computer:Getting Started
### Clone OSTRA
This project is tested under python3.9, cuda11.5 and pytorch1.11.0. An equivalent or higher version is recommended.
```shell
#Clone OSTRA
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ganlab/OSTRA.git
cd OSTRA

#Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install Colmap
Our reconstruction process is based on Colmap. Please follow the instruction and install [Colmap](https://github.com/colmap/colmap) first.

### Prepare Model
All these models are required for OSTRA:
SAM: the default model is [sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth)
DeAOT:the default model is [R50_DeAOTL_PRE_YTB_DAV.pth](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QoChMkTVxdYZ_eBlZhK2acq9KMQZccPJ/view)
XMem：the default model is [XMem-s012.pth](https://github.com/hkchengrex/XMem/releases/download/v1.0/XMem-s012.pth)
Grounding-DINO:the default model is [groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth](https://huggingface.co/ShilongLiu/GroundingDINO/resolve/main/groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth)

### WebUI
We developed WebUI that user can easily access.
```shell
python app.py --device cuda:0
```

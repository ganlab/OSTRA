The ScaleCalculator can adjust the relative scale of 3D models reconstructed during the process by integrating depth images, transforming them into actual-size 3D models.

You can run the script to perform depth-based scale estimation. 
```shell
python ScaleCalculator/main.py 
```
We have provided a sample for you to test in ScaleCalculator/sample.
